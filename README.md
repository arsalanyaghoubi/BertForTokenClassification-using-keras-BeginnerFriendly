# BertForTokenClassification-using-keras
# Beginner friendly repo:
It took me some time to come to a comprehensible and tidy model of Bert for token classification using keras;
I decided to upload it to my github so that it may be helpful to you to learn Bert from scratch.
Basic information on Bert and transformers can be find in my other repostory on BertForSequenceClassification which ,definitely, worth a glimps.
in my code I have written some detailed and basic informations regarding  each line to make the process of learning like a piece of cake.
